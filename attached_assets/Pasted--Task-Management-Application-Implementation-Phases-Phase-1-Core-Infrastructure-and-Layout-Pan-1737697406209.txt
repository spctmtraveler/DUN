üìã Task Management Application - Implementation Phases

Phase 1: Core Infrastructure and Layout

Panel System

App Layout:

Create the banner spanning the entire top of the screen.

Add 6 configurable vertical panels side-by-side below the banner, each with an icon to the left of the panel title as specified in the requirements (e.g., a "gun target" for Priority, a checkbox for Tasks, etc.):

Priority Panel (empty, default toggled closed).

Tasks Panel (includes 4 collapsible list sections one above the other: Triage, A, B, C).

Task Details Panel (placeholder form with ‚ÄúDetails,‚Äù ‚ÄúContacts,‚Äù ‚ÄúResources‚Äù headers).

Hours Panel (display hours from 8 AM to 10 PM with thin lines; no AM/PM labels).

Reflect Panel (empty, title: "Reflect").

Minutes Panel (empty, title: "Minutes").

Panel Visibility Controls:

Add individual toggle buttons for each panel.

Implement state persistence for panel visibility.

Add smooth transition animations for toggling panels.

Panel Layout:

Set fixed maximum width of 560px per panel.

Ensure panels are full-height.

Add horizontal scrolling for multiple visible panels.

Apply dark theme with accent color highlights.

Basic Task Management

Quick Add Feature:

Implement text input field in the banner for task creation.

Submit tasks to the Triage list on Enter.

Display new tasks at the bottom of the Triage panel.

Task Organization Structure:

Create collapsible/expandable sections for Triage, A, B, C panels.

Add caret icons for collapse state.

Phase 2: Task Movement and Organization

Drag and Drop Functionality

Enable vertical reordering within panels.

Add cross-panel drag-and-drop functionality.

Provide visual feedback during drag operations (e.g., shadow or placeholder).

Implement automatic reordering of tasks upon drop.

Order Management

Use decimal-based ordering system with 1000-point spacing.

Preserve task order during panel switches.

Phase 3: Task Interaction and Details

Task Interaction

Selection Behavior:

Allow click-to-select/deselect tasks.

Highlight selected tasks with the accent color.

Ensure only one task is selectable at a time.

Maintain task selection when switching panels.

Task Controls:

Add completion checkbox.

Include delete button (√ó symbol).

Provide a drag handle for reordering.

Add a trigger for the date picker.

Task Details Panel

Add editable fields for:

Title.

Overview text (resizable).

Detailed description (resizable).

Revisit date with calendar picker.

Ensure changes persist automatically.

Phase 4: View Management and Filtering

View Filter Dropdown

Add dropdown in the banner with the following options:

All tasks.

Triage view.

Today's tasks.

Tomorrow's tasks.

This week‚Äôs tasks.

Next week‚Äôs tasks.

This month‚Äôs tasks.

Next month‚Äôs tasks.

Filter Behavior:

Update visible tasks instantly based on the selected filter.

Maintain task selection during filtering.

Preserve panel organization during filtering.

Date Ranges for Filters:

Today: Current local date.

Tomorrow: Day after the current local date.

This Week: Monday 12:00 AM to Sunday 11:59 PM of the current week.

Next Week: Monday 12:00 AM to Sunday 11:59 PM of the following week.

This Month: Current calendar month.

Next Month: Next calendar month.

Phase 5: Revisit Date Management

Date Display

Show compact MM/dd format in task list.

Replace with "Today" or "Tomorrow" dynamically when applicable.

Display full date format in the Task Details Panel.

Date Picker

Add a calendar date picker triggered by the task‚Äôs date field.

Highlight today‚Äôs date with an accent-colored border.

Highlight selected date with an accent-colored background.

Include month navigation.

Phase 6: Real-Time Updates

Implement immediate UI updates for task changes.

Enable automatic task list refresh.

Synchronize content across panels in real-time.

Ensure order updates are reflected immediately.

Phase 7: Error Handling and Feedback

User Feedback

Add toast notifications for key actions (e.g., task creation, completion).

Display error messages for failed operations.

Show loading states for long-running operations.

Provide success confirmations for key actions.

Error Prevention

Prevent empty task creation.

Ensure only valid dates can be selected.

Require confirmation for deletions.

Preserve task order on failed moves.

Phase 8: Final Touches and Optimization

Performance Enhancements

Ensure immediate response for checkbox toggles.

Optimize drag-and-drop animations for smoothness.

Minimize lag during panel switching.

Speed up filter applications.

Color Scheme Refinements

Ensure all colors used in the application are pulled from the config.json file.

Use the specified background, foreground, and accent colors for all elements.

Derive brighter or darker versions of these colors programmatically (e.g., by adjusting brightness or opacity percentages). Apply accent color for interactive elements (e.g., toggles, selections).

Use consistent color highlights for selected tasks and calendar dates.



This phased approach ensures step-by-step development and QA, allowing functionality to build progressively while maintaining a stable foundation.
